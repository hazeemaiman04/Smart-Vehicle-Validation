# Smart Vehicle Data Validation & Error Detection

**Track:** Software Track
**Problem Statement:** Smart Vehicle Data Validation & Error Detection by BJAK

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a robust solution for validating smart vehicle data and detecting anomalies or errors within it. In the context of modern vehicles generating vast amounts of data (telemetry, diagnostics, environmental sensors), ensuring data integrity and accuracy is paramount for safety, performance analysis, and predictive maintenance. This system will help identify malformed, incomplete, or suspicious data points that could indicate sensor malfunctions, communication errors, or even malicious tampering.

## Features

*   **Real-time Data Ingestion:** Capable of receiving and processing vehicle data streams.
*   **Schema Validation:** Ensures incoming data conforms to predefined structures and types.
*   **Rule-Based Validation:** Applies custom business rules (e.g., speed cannot exceed a certain limit, temperature must be within a given range).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Utilizes statistical or machine learning techniques to identify unusual patterns that deviate from expected behavior.
*   **Error Reporting:** Generates detailed reports on detected errors and anomalies, including severity and potential causes.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle high-throughput data from multiple vehicles.

## Tech Stack

The core components of this project are built using:

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for data processing, validation logic, and anomaly detection.
    *   **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It's used to create the data ingestion endpoints and expose validation results.
    *   **Pydantic:** Used extensively with FastAPI for data validation and settings management, ensuring incoming data models are strictly adhered to.
    *   **Pandas/Numpy:** For efficient data manipulation and numerical operations, especially in anomaly detection modules.
    *   **Scikit-learn (Optional):** For implementing more advanced machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithms.
*   **SQLite (or PostgreSQL/MongoDB):** A lightweight, file-based database used for storing validation rules, configuration, and potentially a subset of historical error logs. For production deployments, a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB would be recommended.
*   **Docker:** For containerization, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment for development and deployment.

## How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   `git` (for cloning the repository)
*   `Docker` (optional, for containerized deployment)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Smart-Vehicle-Validation.git
cd Smart-Vehicle-Validation
```
(Note: Replace `https://github.com/your-username/Smart-Vehicle-Validation.git` with the actual repository URL if you push it to GitHub.)

### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file first. See "Project Structure" for details.)

### 4. Download `requirements.txt` 

Before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`, you'll need a `requirements.txt` file. You can download from the given file that consists of: 

```
fastapi==0.103.2
uvicorn==0.23.2
pydantic==2.5.2
pandas==2.1.3
numpy==1.26.2
# scikit-learn==1.3.2 # Uncomment if using ML for anomaly detection
```

### 5. Run the Application

Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
(This assumes your main FastAPI application instance is named `app` within a file named `main.py`.)

The application will typically be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 6. Access API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`. This will allow you to test the API endpoints directly.

## How it Works (Conceptual)

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Vehicle data (e.g., JSON payloads from MQTT brokers or direct HTTP POSTs) is received by the FastAPI application.
2.  **Initial Schema Validation:** Pydantic models immediately validate the incoming data against a predefined schema, checking for correct data types and required fields.
3.  **Rule-Based Validation Engine:** The validated data then passes through a custom rule engine. This engine applies a set of configurable rules (e.g., "tire pressure must be > 28 PSI and < 45 PSI," "engine temperature must be below 250°F").
4.  **Anomaly Detection Module:** For critical data points, an anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., statistical thresholds, isolation forest, or one-class SVM) continuously monitors for significant deviations from learned normal behavior.
5.  **Error Handling & Reporting:** Any validation failures or detected anomalies are logged and reported. This could involve storing them in the database, sending alerts, or returning specific error codes to the data source.

## Future Enhancements

*   **User Interface:** A simple web UI for configuring validation rules, visualizing data streams, and reviewing error reports.
*   **Machine Learning Model Training:** Implement functionality to train and update anomaly detection models with new data.
